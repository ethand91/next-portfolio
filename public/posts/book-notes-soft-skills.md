* In this rapid world of change, the ability to learn is extremely important.
* Education is what remains after one has forgotton what one has learned at school.
* If your education stops with graduation. You're going to be at a distant disadvantage in life.
* One of the most important skills is to learn the skill of self teaching.
* Learning how to learn is a skill that you have to teach yourself.
* If you actually teach what you're trying to learn to someone else, not only do you remember it, but you get a much deeper understanding of it.
* You'll learn best when you take action.
* The best way to learn something is to jump right in and start doing, before you even know what you're doing.
* We tend to absorb more information and develop more meaningful questions about a thing when we're actively playing.
* Learn by playing, by actively doing without really knowing what we're doing.
* Before you read a book on the subject, skim the book and dive right in and start playing around.
* Once you've played around and you have all kinds of questions, only then go back and read the text.
* Then you can take what you've learned and reapply it to your play.
* Finally, seal it all in cement by teaching what you've learned to someone else.
* You have to figure out how to educate yourself in a way that works for you.
* It's important to at least understand a little bit about a subject before diving into it.
* State the reason for learning, it can help define the scope.
* Instead of reading a single book on a subject, try to gather many different resources to help you learn. Not just books.
* Gather as many resources as possible and filter them down.
* Once you have the resources, get an idea what you should learn and in what order you should learn it.
* You need to find the correct path that will get you from point A to point Z in the least amount of time.
* Learn just enough to get started, but not so much that you don't get to explore on your own.
* Write down the questions that you don't have the answers for.
* Curiosity is a critical component of learning, especially self learning.
* Take as much time as you need to throughly understand the subject.
* Only read/watch the parts that are relevant.
* If you really want to understand the subject, you have to teach it.
* You only need to be one step ahead of someone to teach them.
* Explaining to others is a great way to fill in the gaps of your own learning.
* When looking for a mentor, look for someone who is higher up the ladder than you.
* It's important to give back to the community.
* You only have to be one step ahead of a person in some area of life to help them.
* To be a mentor you just need to be observant and patient. Look for a person who truly has a desire to learn and is willing to work hard to do it.
* Everyone is capable of teaching.
* Teaching forces you to confront all the areas in your own knowledge that aren't deep enough to be able to adequently explain them to another person.
* Teaching also forces you to reorganise data in your brain.
* Realise that your job in teaching is to help someone else.
* A degreee isn't required to actually succeed.
